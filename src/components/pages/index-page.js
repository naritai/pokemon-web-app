        The name Pokémon is the romanized contraction of the Japanese brand
        Pocket Monsters (ポケットモンスター Poketto Monsutā). The term
        "Pokémon", in addition to referring to the Pokémon franchise itself,
        also collectively refers to the 809 fictional species that have made
        appearances in Pokémon media as of the release of the seventh generation
        titles Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee! "Pokémon" is
        identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual species
        name; it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokémon" and "many
        Pokémon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".
